## 905. Sort Array By Parity

Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of `A`, followed by all the odd elements of `A`.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [3,1,2,4]
<b>Output:</b> [2,4,3,1]
<b>Explanation:</b> The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

</pre>

**Note:**
1. `1 <= A.length <= 5000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 5000`
