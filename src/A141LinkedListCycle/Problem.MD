## 141. Linked List Cycle

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
<b>Output:</b> true
<b>Explanation:</b> There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> head = [1,2], pos = 0
<b>Output:</b> true
<b>Explanation:</b> There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> head = [1], pos = -1
<b>Output:</b> false
<b>Explanation:</b> There is no cycle in the linked list.

</pre>

**Constraints:**
- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
