## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (**where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> 

</pre>

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
- <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
- All Node.val are unique.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.
